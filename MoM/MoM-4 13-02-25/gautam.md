- Role-based access. (one role is field staff for example)
- When admin logs in, show a list of clients.
- when a client is clicked, show the list of their projects.
- Give field staff access to a project for a certain time.
- Field staff shouldn't be able to delete data.
- have a provision for admin to manually enter the project completion percentage based on their estimations.
- have a toggle to decide between to use automated percentage determining (a hybrid between how long the project has run for versus what percentage of tasks are done) and manual percentage entering.
- status indicators - for each task. status will manually be set by admin.
- let admin add kpis for a project.
- in case you can't provide a visualization, have a provision for them to upload their own chart.
- project page will have 3 tabs, visual overview, success stories, gallery.
- dont worry about drill down and data collection for now
- TO DO: design the timeline view and show ma'am
