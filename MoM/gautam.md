## Meet 1, Jan 13 2025

- Anusandhan Social consultants LLP wants a dashboard that lets the people investing in them see how their projects are going.
- Users: Anusandhan and the clients. Have a different view for each.
- Clients have a sort of read-only view seeing the status of projects **that are related to them only**.
- Clients should be able to leave comments on parts of the project status.
- Show milestones, budgets, targets and indicators.
- Assign attributes to each project. Examples, thrust area (like education, women empowerment, healthcare, among others), location.
- Let clients filter based on these project parameters.
- Notify Anusandhan when they receive a comment from clients.
- Ask about a subdomain. Will we be receiving one?

- Someone would want to see the status of, say, the project in the current quarter compared to the project status in the last quarter. Try to implement
- how many projects completed on time?
- average budgets?
- how many on time? delayed? (kinda redundant)
- LOTS of data visualization. For each numerical metric, have the user be able to select what the mode of displaying that data should be. Either a bar chart, or pie chart, etc.
- Need a feature to block a client's view access from project.
