- Anusandhan Social consultants LLP wants a dashboard that lets the people investing in them see how their projects are going.
- Users: Anusandhan and the clients. Have a different view for each.
- Clients have a sort of read-only view seeing the status of projects **that are related to them only**.
- Clients should be able to leave comments on parts of the project status.
- Show milestones, budgets, targets and indicators.
- Assign attributes to each project. Examples, thrust area (like education, women empowerment, healthcare, among others), location.
- Let clients filter based on these project parameters.
- Notify Anusandhan when they receive a comment from clients.
